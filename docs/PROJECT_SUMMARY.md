- **User Management**: Profile creation and management via Solana wallet authentication
- **Time Slot Management**: CRUD operations for time slots
- **Bidding System**: Auction bid management
- **Dispute Resolution**: Conflict resolution workflow
- **Notification System**: Email and in-app notifications

### 3. Frontend Application (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS)
